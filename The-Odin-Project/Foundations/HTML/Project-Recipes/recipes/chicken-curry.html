        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            **Saut√© Aromatics:** Heat oil or ghee in a large skillet or pot over
            medium heat. Add chopped onion and cook until softened and lightly
            golden, about 5-7 minutes. Add minced garlic and grated ginger, cook
            for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Add Spices:** Stir in cumin, coriander, turmeric, and cayenne
            pepper. Cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly, until the spices are
            aromatic.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Brown Chicken:** Add chicken pieces to the pot and cook, stirring
            occasionally, until lightly browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Simmer Curry:** Stir in diced tomatoes (with their juice), coconut
            milk, and chicken broth. Bring the mixture to a simmer. Reduce heat
            to low, cover, and let it simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until the
            chicken is cooked through and tender, and the sauce has thickened
            slightly. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Season and Serve:** Season the curry with salt and black pepper to
            taste. Garnish with fresh chopped cilantro. Serve hot with cooked
            rice or warm naan bread.
