        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            **Prepare the Meat Sauce:** In a large skillet or Dutch oven, cook
            ground beef (or sausage) and onion over medium heat until meat is
            browned and onion is tender. Drain off excess fat. Stir in garlic
            and cook for 1 minute more. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste,
            water, sugar (if using), basil, fennel seeds (if using), Italian
            seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer, then
            reduce heat, cover, and simmer for at least 30 minutes (longer is
            better for flavor development), stirring occasionally.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Cook Noodles:** While sauce simmers, cook lasagna noodles
            according to package directions until al dente. Drain and rinse with
            cold water to prevent sticking.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Prepare Ricotta Mixture:** In a medium bowl, combine ricotta
            cheese, egg, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and nutmeg
            (if using). Mix well.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Assemble Lasagna:** Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Spread about
            1/2 cup of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.
            Arrange 3-4 lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread half of the
            ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles. Top with about 1 1/2 cups
            of mozzarella cheese, then about 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce. Repeat
            layers: noodles, remaining ricotta, mozzarella, meat sauce. Top with
            remaining noodles, then the rest of the meat sauce, and finally, a
            generous layer of mozzarella and a sprinkle of Parmesan.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Bake:** Cover the baking dish loosely with aluminum foil (you can
            spray the underside of the foil with cooking spray to prevent cheese
            from sticking). Bake for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake for an
            additional 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown and bubbly. Let
            stand for 10-15 minutes before serving to allow it to set.
