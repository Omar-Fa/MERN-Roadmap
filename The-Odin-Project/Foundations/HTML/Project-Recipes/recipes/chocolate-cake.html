        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            **Prepare Cake Batter:** Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and
            flour two 8-inch round cake pans. In a large bowl, whisk together
            flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. In
            a separate bowl, whisk together buttermilk, oil, eggs, and vanilla
            extract. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix
            until just combined. Stir in the hot water (or coffee) until smooth.
            The batter will be thin.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Bake Cakes:** Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans.
            Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a wooden skewer inserted into the
            center comes out clean. Let cakes cool in pans for 10 minutes before
            inverting onto a wire rack to cool completely.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Make Frosting:** While cakes cool, prepare frosting. In a large
            bowl, beat softened butter until creamy. Gradually beat in cocoa
            powder, then powdered sugar alternately with milk, starting and
            ending with powdered sugar. Beat until smooth and creamy. Stir in
            vanilla extract and salt. If too thick, add more milk 1 tsp at a
            time; if too thin, add more powdered sugar.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Assemble Cake:** Once cakes are completely cool, place one cake
            layer on a serving plate. Spread about 1/3 of the frosting evenly
            over the top. Place the second cake layer on top and spread the
            remaining frosting over the top and sides of the cake.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Serve:** Slice and serve! The cake can be stored at room
            temperature in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
